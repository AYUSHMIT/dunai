This project is split in three parts:

- Dunai: a reactive library that combines monads and arrows.
- BearRiver: Yampa implemented on top of Dunai.
- Examples: ballbounce, haskanoid
  - sample applications that work both on traditional Yampa and BearRiver.

We need to add examples of apps written in classic FRP, reactive values, etc. A
new game, in honor of Paul Hudak, has been designed to work best with this
library. It will also be added to the repo.

Dunai uses monad transformers, but it's still very experimental and we have not
agreed on either the syntax or intended behaviour of trans-monadic reactive
networks. So, don't get too caught up in the current implementation, and don't
freak out if you can't understand why there are three implementations of the
same function.

PLEASE, DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE IT YET. We will do so in due time.
