* Are RModules more general than monoids? Why aren't sum and sumfrom defined
over monoids?

  Motivation: There already is a standard vector library, but it's too heavy
for mobile games. We currently provide a custom implementation of VectorSpace.
If we use monoid or something more general available in base, people can choose
between using our VectorSpace (provided separately) or the one in 'vector'.
